## Description
For unit 18's homework assignment I was tasked with saving values offline by utilizing indexedDB. With indexedDB users are able to store their submitted values while in an offline state. Once the users goes back online then the values will be stored into the database. I found this assignment to be a very important learning experience because it accommodates for a what if scenario and it is nice to know that there is a feature we can implement so that data loss can be prevented.
